###Recipe Generator App

In the past week after learning the the basic of Vanilla JS, I tried to implement my knowlegde. Initially I was a bit overwhelmed with the amount of things you can build using JS but I decided to start with a simple random[recipe generator app](https://github.com/jusergit30/RandomRecipeGenerator.git).  I am learning JS from the udemy course by the [net ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg).  You can find it [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/).

The concept of the app I made was to make use of the api request functionality of JavaScript, fetch the data over the network and display the details of the recipe on the browser. I made use of the [fetch() api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to request and fetch the data.

To talk a bit about API request, the fetch api simply make a request over the network and returns a promise. We get the data once the promise is resolved. The concept of promises and fetching data over network can be tricky to grasp at first go. After reading about [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise),fetch() api on web, I feel i got to learn a lot more about these concept by implementing them in project.

You can find the repo on github [here](https://github.com/jusergit30/RandomRecipeGenerator.git). I used [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host the app. Netlify makes life so simple :)

I also brushed up on ES6 stuff and plan to get hands dirty with React.
